1. Introduction

	slGrid uses a plugin system to define how table cell contents should be
        displayed. For example, you can transform an email address into a 
        a clickable mailto-link.
        There is a special plugin that is called before a new row is added to
  	the table when in editing mode (MODE_EDIT). This allows you to run 
	additional filters on the user input (for example, to check for in-
	appropriate words), or to add additional content, such as an ID field.

2. Available Plugins
	
	By default, slGrid ships with three default plugins:
	email	- Shows an email address as clickable link.
	url	- Shows an URL as clickable link.
		  Arguments:
		  target  	- link target
		  display	- display name (ie what is displayed instead of
				  the link.
	image 	- Shows a filename as image.
		  Arguments:
		  image_directory - directory of the images

3. Setting Plugins
	
	To set a plugin for a column, you use this function 
	Grid::SetPlugin($column_name, $plugin, $args = NULL);
 	string $column_name  - 	Name of the table column that should be modified by this
				plugin
	string $plugin	     - 	Name of the plugin. You need a file called like this
				(class.$plugin.php) in the plugins directory, containing
				a class called like this.
	array $args	     -  Optional array with additional parameters.

	Example:
	$_SESSION["grid"]->SetPlugin("email_field", "email");
	$_SESSION["grid"]->SetPlugin("url_field", "link", array("target" => "_blank"));
	
	You can set multiple plugins per column.

	There is a special output plugin called "all" (as $column_name). This plugin will
	be called for *all* columns.

	To set a special plugin that is called before inserts, use a $column_name called
	"database". Example:
	$_SESSION["grid"]->SetPlugin("database", "add_id");
	
4. Creating Output Plugins

	Output plugins are created by deriving a class named after the plugin from
	the Grid_Plugin default class, and by placing it into a file named after
	the plugin in the plugin directory.
	Please have a look at the default plugins there for examples.
	
	The function Grid_Plugin::generateContent($cell, $args) is the work horse
	that will act on the cell contents and return the modified version.
	string $cell	- This is the contents of the table cell.
	array $args	- Arguments that were passed in SetPlugin. Two arguments are
			  always passed:
			  id - 	 The value of the unique database column (set by 
				 Grid::SetUniqueDatabaseColumn().
			  field -The name of the table field. 
			  mode - Either "view" (if the field is displayed normally),
				 "edit" (if the field is being edited, ie is the value
				 of the input text field),
				 or "insert" (if the plugin is being called for the
				 "add new row" fields on top of the table).
				 In case mode is "edit", the name of the input next field
				 is also passed as argument "name".

	Whatever you return from the function will be displayed. Usually, it will make
	most sense to modify the cell contents somehow in your generateContent() 
	function, and then return the modified version.

5. Creating Database Plugins

	While database plugins (ie the plugins that are called before inserting a new
	row into the table) share the class structure of output plugins, the function
	generateContent accepts different parameters:
	Grid_Plugin::generateContent($column_names, $column_values)
	array $column_names	- Array of the column names that are going to be inserted.
	array $column_values	- Array of the values that are going to be inserted.

	The function should return an array of these two arguments. Example:

		$column_names[] = "user_id";
		$column_values[] = 1;
		return(array($column_names, $column_values));
